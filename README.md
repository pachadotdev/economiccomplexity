A wrapper of different methods from Linear Algebra for the equations
introduced in The Atlas of Economic Complexity and related literature.
This package provides standard matrix and graph output that can be used
seamlessly with other packages. See <doi:10.21105/joss.01866> for a
summary of these methods and its evolution in literature.
