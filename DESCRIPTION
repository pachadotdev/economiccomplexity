Description: A wrapper of different computation methods to create bipartite 
  networks such as countries and their exported products, and different kind of
  relations such as countries and their spoken languages. This package 
  implements the equations described in 
  Mariani, et al. (2015) <doi:10.1140/epjb/e2015-60298-7> and 
  Hausmann, et al. (2014) <doi:10.7551/mitpress/9647.001.0001>.
