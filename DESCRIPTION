Description: A wrapper of different methods from Linear Algebra for the equations
  introduced in The Atlas of Economic Complexity and related literature. This
  package provides standard matrix and graph output that can be used seamlessly
  with other packages. See <doi:10.21105/joss.01866> for a summary
  of these methods and its evolution in literature.
