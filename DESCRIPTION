Description: A wrapper of different indices and networks commonly used in Economic Complexity
  to explore bipartite relations such as countries and their exported products. These methods
  are also useful for different kind of relations such as countries and their spoken languages.
  The functions within this package correspond to code implementations of the equations 
  described in Hausmann, et al. (2005) <doi:10.3386/w11905>, Hausmann, et al. (2014) 
  <doi:10.7551/mitpress/9647.001.0001>, and Mariani, et al. (2015) <doi:10.1140/epjb/e2015-60298-7>.
